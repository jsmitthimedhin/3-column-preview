# 3-column-preview
V.1 of Frontend Mentor's 3-Column-Preview challenge, built from scratch by using an image file as a reference.
This version is the rough draft of the completed challenge. 

## Things that will be updated in v.2 :
  1. Refactoring of CSS to use variables instead of hard-coding all the colors in different elements and pseudo-elements.
  2. Fixing repeated code throughout HTML elements, especially Bootstrap classes with similar margins and padding.
